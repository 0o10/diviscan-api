# Diviscan APIs

A RESTful API for making RPC calls to the Divi blockchain. Used for the diviscan block explorer.

# Usage

All endpoints can be retrieved by accessing 'https://api.diviscan.io' or you can host your own using this library.

# Custom hosting

1. Fork this repository and `npm install` all dependencies.

2. Download the [Divi blockchain](https://github.com/divicoin/divi) for your operating system

3. You will need a full Divi node running on the server where these APIs are hosted in order for the configuration to speak to the daemon.

Example config.js:
```javascript
module.exports = {
    config: {
        protocol: 'http',
        user: keys.user, 
        pass: keys.pass,
        host: '127.0.0.1',
        port: '51473'
    }
}
```
4. In the root directory create a file titled `keys.js`

Example keys.js
```javascript
module.exports = {
    user: 'RandomName',
    pass: 'SuperSecretRandomPasswordChangeOrBePwned'
}
```

5. Run `./divid -reindex -addressindex` on startup. 

**NOTE:** You can also add `addressindex=1` to your `divi.conf` file to achieve the same effect. You should always `-reindex` the node on startup regardless.

# Endpoints

Node specific endpoints will only return data based on the node where the API is being hosted.
